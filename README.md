Website Kubernetes Deployment
In this project, we'll deploy a website as a service on Kubernetes. We'll define alert rules based on key performance indicators (KPIs) like CPU utilization, memory usage, and request rates, 
allowing the detection and response to potential issues before they affect user experience.

Project Objectives

Deploy UpCommerce's website as a service on Kubernetes.

Define alert rules based on key performance indicators (KPIs) using Prometheus.

Monitor CPU utilization, memory usage, and request rates to ensure optimal performance and availability of the website.

Respond to potential issues proactively by setting up alerts and notifications.

Gain insights into the behavior of the website and Kubernetes infrastructure using PromQL queries and visualization tools.
